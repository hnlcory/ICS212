# Pseudocode for deleteRecord and Test Plans for Project1 [13 pts]

<strong style="color:red">There are two parts (pseudocode and test plans). Please check each part.</strong>

# Part1: Pseudocode [8 pts]

Write the pseudocode for the function, `deleteRecord`, to delete a record from a linked list of records.

Assume the following variables are already defined, initialized and available for you to use:

- `start`: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- `uaccountno`: The user's account number (integer)

Assume the following struct definition:
```
struct record
{
    int               accountno;
    char              name[25];
    char              address[50];
    struct record*    next;
};
```

The pseudocode must have the following features:

1. If a record with the specified account number is found, delete it from the linked list AND return 0

1. Otherwise, return -1

1. It must not cause a memory leak.

1. There must be no use of any C code (also **no curly braces, no semicolon**) in the pseudocode

   **Don't even think of writing C code first and then translating it to pseudocode.**
   It is no point to do it, and many students in the past also ended up with hard time to translate each line.

1. You may ONLY use the allowed vocabulary from the list below with variations to accommodate different memory locations

1. <strong style='color:red'>Frequent invalid usage of vocabulary could result in 0 points</strong>

1. Functioning pseudocode can be about 30 lines. If you write excessively long pseudocde (like 50+ lines), your pseudocode highly likely contains some problems or redundant parts.

# Vocabulary list

replace the bold parts with your variables and expressions.

1. define **variable_type** called **variable_name**

   _note: you can newly define <strong style="color:red">ONLY</strong> these variable types:_

   - an int
   - a pointer to record

   example:
   ```
   define an int called i
   define a pointer to record called temp
   ```

1. release the space whose address is in **variable_name**

   note: **variable_name** must be a pointer to record.

   example:
   ```
   release the space whose address is in temp
   ```

1. copy from **variable_name1** to **variable_name2**

   This copies the value in **variable_name1** to **variable_name2**.

   If the variables are character arrays, you can assume you can directly copy the characters.

   You can also assign a result from an expression or a constant value. (be sure about the data type. NULL is for a pointer, not an integer!)

   example:
   ```
   copy from temp1 to temp2
   copy from string1 to string2
   copy from i + 1 to i
   copy from 10 to i
   copy from NULL to temp
   ```

1. **field_name** in the record whose address is in **variable_name**

   By this expression, you can access a field inside the record.

   note1: **field_name** must be one of the fields in struct record.

   note2: **variable_name** must be a pointer to record, but <strong style="color:red">must not be the next field in a record</strong>.

   example:
   ```
   copy from name in the record whose address is in temp to val
   copy from val to name in the record whose address is in temp
   ```

   BUT <span style="color:red">DON'T do this!</span>:
   ```
   copy from val to name in the record whose address is in next in the record whose address is in temp
   ```

1. Comparison

   You can use the following comparisons:

   - **variable_name1** is / is not equal to **variable_name2**

   - **variable_name1** is less than **variable_name2**

   - **variable_name1** is greater than **variable_name2**

1. while( Comparison )

   _note1: inside a while loop, put 4 white spaces for indents_

   _note2: you CANNOT use a break or continue statement._

   example:
   ```
   while( accountno in the record whose address is in temp is equal to 0 )
        ...
   while( accountno in the record whose address is in temp is not equal to 0 )
        ...
   ```

1. do-while( Comparison )

   _note1: inside a while loop, put 4 white spaces for indents_

   _note2: you CANNOT use a break or continue statement._

   example:
   ```
   do
       ...
   while( accountno in the record whose address is in temp is equal to 0 )

   do
       ...
   while( accountno in the record whose address is in temp is not equal to 0 )
   ```

1. if( Comparison )

   _note1: inside an if statement, put 4 white spaces for indents_

   _node2: you can use "else"._

   example:
   ```
   if( var is not equal to 0 )
       ...
   else if( var2 is equal to 0 )
       ...
   else
       ...
   ```

1. Combining comparisons

   - If necessary, you may use "&&" and "||" to combine comparisons

   example:
   ```
   if ( var is not equal to 0 && var2 is equal to 0)
    ...
   else if ( var is less than 0 || var2 is greater than 0)
    ...
   ```

1. return **variable_name**

   This exits the function with the value given by **variable_name**

   note 1: <strong>variable_name</strong> must be an integer

   note 2: you must not use this statement more than once

# Template and Example

Use [this template of pseudocode](./pseudocode.txt).
Please replace "<strong>* WRITE YOUR PSEUDOCODE HERE</strong>" with your pseudocode.

The following pseudocode shows an example demonstrating the vocabulary given above.

```
-----------------------------------
sampleFunc
------------------------------------

define a pointer to record called temp

if( start is not equal to NULL )
    copy from start to temp
    copy from next in the record whose address is in temp to start
    release the space whose address is in temp
```

# Tracing
After you are done, trace your pseudocode with the following test cases and fill in **this file: [trace.xlsx](./trace.xlsx)**.

_Note: You don't have to have exactly the same data in the example. Just make up your own data for each of the test cases._

- Trying to delete a record in an empty list

   For example,
   - `uaccountno`: **1000**
   - Heap:
      **No record**

- Trying to delete the **first** record in a list of three records

   For example,
   - `uaccountno`: **1300**
   - Heap:
      - Record1:
         - `accountno`: **1300**
         - `name`: David Lassner
         - `address`: 2500 Campus Rd.
      - Record2:
         - `accountno`: 1200
         - `name`: Ravi Narayan
         - `address`: 1680 East-West Rd.
      - Record3:
         - `accountno`: 1100
         - `name`: Tetsuya Idota
         - `address`: 1-1 Chiyoda

- Trying to delete the second record in a list of three records

   For example,
   - `uaccountno`: **1100**
   - Heap:
      - Record1:
         - `accountno`: 1200
         - `name`: David Lassner
         - `address`: 2500 Campus Rd.
      - Record2:
         - `accountno`: **1100**
         - `name`: Ravi Narayan
         - `address`: 1680 East-West Rd.
      - Record3:
         - `accountno`: 900
         - `name`: Tetsuya Idota
         - `address`: 1-1 Chiyoda

# Part2: TEST PLAN [5 pts]

Write a test plan consisting of a series of test cases and desired outcomes to completely test
[Project 1](../project1/project1.html).
Use this template: [testplan.xlsx](./testplan.xlsx). Replace the sample test cases with your actual test cases.

Plus, your test plan must achieve the following requirements:

- Each test case must be "small."

   Think like each test case is an action for a human tester to take step by step.
   To choose a specific option, "Type X and hit Enter" can be one test case. To provide inputs for a specific option, "Give the following inputs: ..." can also be one test case. So a lengthy instruction composed of multiple actions like "Run the program. Add X records. Delete Y records. Print them. Then, exit." CANNOT be a single test case.

- Test cases must be "sequential."

   Your test plan is to be conducted sequentially from the first test case to the last, so each test case depends on the results of its previous test case.

- A test case must provide specific testing inputs.

   Testing results must be the same even if a different person follows your test plan. **If some test case asks you to just "input some random number" or "give an incorrect name", is it a good test case?**

You will need around 30 to 40 test cases to go through all the requirements.
