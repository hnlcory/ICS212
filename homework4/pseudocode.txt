addRecord

*** Assume the following variables are already defined. ***

- start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
- uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)
- uname: a character array containing the user's name
- uaddress: a character array containing the user's address


struct record
{
    int               accountno;
    char              name[25];
    char              address[50];
    struct record*    next;
};

* WRITE YOUR PSEUDOCODE HERE

define an int called status
copy from -1 to status
define a pointer to record called temp

// if start == null, list empty create first thing and leave
if ( start is qual to NULL )
copy from NULL to start
allocate a heap space and store its address into start
copy from uaccountno to accountno in the record whose address is in start
copy from uname to name in the record whose address is in start
copy from uaddress to address in the record whose address is in start
copy from NULL to next in the record whose address is start
copy from 0 to status


// else, start has address of record, at least list of 1+ things.
allocate a heap space and store its address in the next field whose address is in temp
