start: The pointer to the first record of the list (or NULL)
uaccountno: The user's account number (integer)

define an int called status
define an int called itr
define a pointer to record called temp

if (start is equal to NULL)
copy from -1 to status

else
copy from start to temp

while (status is equal to 0)
if (the accountno whose address is stored in temp is equal to uaccountno)
*do the remove and patch list thingy here**

else
copy from the next of the record whose address is stored in temp to temp
copy from itr + 1 to itr
