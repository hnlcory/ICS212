After testing through my test case from project 1, I can say that my program successfully met all requirements. If we do ignore step #22 which is an issue on how the test case itself is written, we can see that the program completes all tasks flawlessly and has passed any of my testing outside of the test plan itself. I also included the ability to terminate the program if any more arguments are given besides the ./project or ./project_debug (if the user provided ./project *insert data*), it will state too many arguments are given and quit. In the future I would like to focus on simplification and efficiency of the code as I believe some methods have over complicated ways of completing tasks as well as making the user interface more appealing to the user.
